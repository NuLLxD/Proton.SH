# Proton.SH
A shell script created to simplify launching arbitrary executables inside the active Steam proton environment  

Bassed off work by [chrisgdouglas](https://github.com/chrisgdouglas/cehelper)

## Features
Automatically detect steam installation.  
Automatically locate Cheat Engine in the users home directory.  
Prompt for proton version.  
Launch arbitrary executables with custom path.  
If at any point the script fails to do these things it will request user input.

This shell script keeps it incredibly simple and requires very little user input and virtually no configuration.  Lightweight, speed and ease of use.

## Usage
1. Clone the repo or download the script.
2. Install Cheat Engine in your home directory (eg. ~/Cheat Engine 7.5)
3. Open terminal and browse to your script directory.  
4. Give the script execute permissions  
```chmod +x proton.sh```  
5. Run the script  
```./proton.sh```
