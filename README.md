# Proton.SH
A shell script created to simplify launching arbitrary executables inside the active Steam proton environment  

Based off work by [chrisgdouglas](https://github.com/chrisgdouglas/cehelper)

## Features
Automatically detect steam installation.  
Automatically locate Cheat Engine in the users home directory.  
Automatically detect proton version.  
Launch arbitrary executables with custom path.  
Launch a windows command shell.  
If at any point the script fails to do these things it will request user input.  

## Why Proton.SH?
This shell script keeps it incredibly simple and requires very little user input and virtually no configuration.  Lightweight, speed and ease of use.

## Usage
1. Clone the repo or download the script.
2. Install Cheat Engine in your home directory (eg. ~/Cheat Engine 7.5)
3. Open terminal and browse to your script directory.  
4. Give the script execute permissions  
```chmod +x proton.sh```  
5. Run the script  
```./proton.sh```
