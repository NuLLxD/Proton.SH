# Steam Proton Cheat Engine Helper

## A simple bash script that makes launching Cheat Engine easier for Steam Proton running in linux.

This script quickly determines the prefix used by the currently running game.
Once Cheat Engine is installed in the prefix, you can easily and automatically launch Cheat Engine!

- You will need to have Cheat Engine extracted to your system.
- You will need to have the Cheat Engine executable in your Proton game's prefix.

If you need more that what this script offers, both prontontrick and protonhax provide significantly more control and options, please check them out!

*Of course, use Cheat Engine at your own risk. It is possible to break, crash, or corrupt your game with Cheat Engine.
Proceed with caution, and use at your own risk. I cannot accept any responsibility for any misuse of Cheat Engine.*
